	<h1>Pattern Drafts</h1>
	<h2>Understanding fundamentals of reading and designing a pattern draft for loom weaving.</h2>
	
<div class="main">
	<img src="images/waffle_draft.png">
	<div>
		<p>Similarly to how punchcards inform a knitting machine of how to control the needles, pattern 
		drafts for weaving provide a clear visualisation of what warp threads are being lifted and how 
		they will intersect with the weft yarn. Regardless if you are using a manual loom or a digital/punchcard-based 
		one such as a Jacquard, it defines what happens at each step and a sketch of what your resulting fabric 
		will look like. The diagram below, illustrates the relationship between the four sections that comprise a 
		pattern draft graph. <br>
		<br>Threading: This is showing the pattern that the warp is set up in through the 'headles' and 'harnesses'
		in the middle section of the loom. Each row signifies a harness and a square/cell is 1 headle. Once you
		start weaving this cannot be changed anymore.
		<br>Tie-up: This is relevant for floor looms, table looms use different harness mechanisms where
		no tie-up is needed. Below the main section of the loom that holds the harnesses, the 'lams' (wooden bars underneath the harnesses)
		need to be attached to the floor treadles. This section is read by the column, from left to right,
		within which the cells will connect the information in the threading and the treadling pattern to
		dictate which harnesses are being lifted by each treadle. The tie-up can be changed at any point
		during weaving.
		<br>Treadling pattern: The treadling sequence provides the weaver the most flexibility and creativity
		once the loom has been set-up. Experimenting with the relationship of the tie-up and sequence 
		can create varieties of patterns and fabric densities or intricacies.
		<br>Resulting fabric: Following the filled-in cells of the prior 3 sections, the grid design of the final fabric
		can be sketched out - or otherwise automatically filled in if using a digital design tool, such as Treadl.com for the design on the left.

		<p>This is a fabric sample of the pattern draft above. You can see how the diamond forms in the draft translate
		to the actual weaving. This specific technique is called waffle weave, the visual effect and malleability 
		that the diamond structurecreates comes as a result of a range of short->long warp and weft floats. In the 
		pattern draft, the long horizontal stripes (weft) and vertical stripes (warp) show the floats, which are otherwise
		typically something to avoid to prevent instability of the fabric or them catching on your surroundings.
