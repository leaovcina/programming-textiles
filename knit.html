	<h1>What is a knit machine punchcard?</h1>
	<h2>How do they help in textile design exploration?</h2>



	<div class="main">
		<div class="punchcard" style="height: 300px;">
			<br>
			<p style="margin: 30px;">Alongside manipulating the knitting machine manually to create textures and colour changes,
				you can help the machine know what to do and when to do it by itself with the 
				use of a punchcard. Depending on the technique you would like to use, whether you 
				punch a hole or leave it unpunched informs the machine of different things, always
				interacting with other machine functions that you set up yourself.
			<br> Some examples of techniques that can be done with punchcard are:
			<br> Punch lace
			<br> Slip and Tuck
			<br> Fair Isle Colourwork
			<br> Knit-Weave
			</p>
		</div>
		<div><img src="images/punchcard1 copy.png"></div>
		<div class="punchcard" style="height: 300px;">
			<p style="margin: 30px;"> Approaches to creating and designing punchcards are not monoliths per individual technique,
				depending on which techniques you are interested in, sometimes they can be flexible. For example, The slip and 
				tuck techniques are different in the outcome of the fabric but the punchcard itself is interchangeable, the settings of
				the machine are what create the differences. 
				<br> From a technical standpoint, knitting machines are different between various manufacturers, however the punchcard
				function if your machine has it, works the same by feeding your punchcard through a slit at the top of the knitting bed 
				and connecting the far ends of the punchcard for a continuous outcome in the fabric. Within the punchcard slit there are 
				small pedals that recognize where holes have been punched to work with the rest of the machine settings to activate or stall
				the correct needles as the knitting carriage passes over them.<br>
				<br> In the context of textile production, punchcards provide a higher rate of efficiency and likelihood of accuracy 
				when creating larger batches of fabric. However, when considering textile design exploration, it creates an interesting
				opportunity to play with colours more easily for a certain sample, or testing a pattern/texture/overall design.
