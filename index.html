	<h2>What is a punchcard?</h2>
		<p>Alongside manipulating the machine manually to create textures and colour changes,
			you can help the machine know what to do and when to do it by itself with the 
		use of a punchcard. Depending on the technique you would like to use, whether you 
		punch a hole or leave it unpunched informs the machine of different things, always
		interacting with other machine functions that you set up yourself.</p>
